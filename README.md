## To run the project, use commands `npm install`, `node .\app.js`  

## Open `localhost:3000` on your browser to visit the site  
  
  
    

### Before you run this project, please add a `.env` file to the project directory containing:
```
MYSQL_HOST=
MYSQL_USER=
MYSQL_PASSWORD=
MYSQL_DATABASE=
```
The `env.txt` file contains the template, simply fill in the values and rename the file to `.env`. That should work.  
  

### If you are running this project for the first time,  

you will have to initialize some tables in the SQL database you have mentioned in the `.env` file  

To do so, simply run the command `node setup.js` when you run the project the first time.
Or, you can use the MySQL Command Line to manually run the two commands given in the `setup.txt` file. Then you can run the project as usual with the command `node app.js`.
